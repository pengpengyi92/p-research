"""Agent adapter protocol and reference agents.

The harness is agent-agnostic: any agent that implements the ``observe``
protocol can be evaluated. Two deterministic reference agents ship for
validation and demonstration — one disciplined, one reckless — so the four
checks can be shown to actually discriminate discipline from recklessness.
No LLM calls anywhere in the harness; everything is deterministic.
